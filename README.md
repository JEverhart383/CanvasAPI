# CanvasAPI

This is a quick HTTPS request object using Node JS to access the Canvas API. Right now, the access token is a parameter in the URL. 

Possible pull requests: 
1. send access token in options using headers or auth
2. concatanate path in a more modular fashion 
3. parse JSON response based on required info
